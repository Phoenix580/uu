  <h2>Education background</h2>

 Ningbo City colleague 09/2020-06/2023
  <h2>Academic performance</h2>
<p>I like reading, reading can let me know a lot of things, increase knowledge, open up new horizons. At the same time, I also like cleaning, like to do housework, share the work. Work can make people relax. But my weakness is carelessness and I ignore details every time. At the same time more impulse, not so easy impulse. I wish I could get rid of this bad habit

  Make a list of things in your life that didn't turn out well. Making a list of your failures or weaknesses can help you identify your weaknesses. Sum up the commonalities of these things. Once you have identified your weakness, start developing strategies to overcome it. Ask for feedback. It helps to ask for advice from someone who knows you well. Use your strengths to overcome your weaknesses. It builds your confidence and enables you to do more of what you once thought impossible.

Tourism geography, in the tourism geography, the teacher will talk about the great rivers and mountains of the motherland, local folk characteristics, but also talk about tourism strategies and so on. Class at the same time to see all the famous mountains and rivers, see the bustling world, is not a very happy thing. </p>
